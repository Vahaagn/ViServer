# ViChat #

In order to increase my programming experience I've started to create my first server&client app what became ViChat. Now when it's working I'm planning to develop it so that I'll get much more experience.

### ViServer ###

* Managing clients
* Receiving messages
* Sending messages

### ViClient ###

* GUI Application
* Connecting with server
* Receiving and sending messages

### ViData ###

* Packet structure
* Database connection for registering and logging in

### Note ###

Please notice that it's my first that big project and I'm trying to develop my skills to higher level. If you've found some bugs or know better solutions than I'll be thankful if you'll share it with me.
